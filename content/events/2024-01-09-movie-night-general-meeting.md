CSSZ invites you to a General Meeting followed by a Movie night.

## General Meeting

The General Meeting will take place from **18:30** until **19:30**.

## Movie Night

Starting at **19:30**, we'll be watching the Czech movie _Pelíšky_ with English subtitles.

The movie is a classic of the Czech cinematography and is a must-see for anyone interested in Czech culture.

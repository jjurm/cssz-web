Pokud máte jakékoliv dotazy, neváhejte nás kontaktovat. Informace na této stránce mají tendenci se rychle měnit. Pokud naleznete nepřesné nebo nekompletní informace, dejte nám vědět na info@cssz.ch.\nUbytování Sehnat ubytování v Curychu může být velmi složité, vyplácí se proto začít včas, ideálně aspoň 2-4 měsíce před začátkem studia, protože potávka po studentském bydlení je extrémně vysoká. Studenti ETH/UZH bydlí převážně ve sdílených bytech (WG). Nejpopulárnější webové stránky pro hledání ubytování jsou:\nWOKO je nejoblíbenějším poskytovatelem studentského ubytování v Curychu a organizace nabízející některé z nejdostupnějších možností studentského bydlení, včetně jednolůžkových pokojů, sdílených bytů a studií. Chcete-li si pronajmout pokoj od WOKO nebo Juwo, musíte být zapsáni na univerzitě v Curychu a mladší 28 let, běžně označované jako kritéria Woko. Juwo (Jugendwohnnetz) je organizace poskytující dostupné možnosti bydlení pro studenty ve věku 16 – 25 let a nabízí řadu různých možností bydlení, včetně bytů, sdílených bytů a společných bydlení. Platí stejná kritéria jako u WOKO. WG Zimmer je portál na hledání sdíleného bydlení. Flatfox je další alternativa k WG Zimmer. Pro studenty ETH existuje možnost pokusit se sehnat pokoj na kampusu Höngerrberg ve Student Village nebo Living Science. Největší šance je sledovat společnou Facebookovou skupinu obou objektů, kde stávající studenti nabízejí volné pokoje.\nPomoct umí občas i Housing Office ETH/UZH, která poskytuje vyhledávací portál a někdy i přiděluje byty / pokoje zahraničním studentům, doktorandům, profesorům a akademickým hostům ETH/UZH.\nPovolení k pobytu Ani Češi ani Slováci vízum k pobytu ve Švýcarsku nepotřebují. Všichni ovšem potrebují povolení k pobytu (Residence Permit / Aufenthaltsbewilligung). O povolení k pobytu je nutné zažádat do 14 dnů od příjezdu do Švýcarska na úřadě pro hlášení obyvatel (Personenmeldeamt Zürich). O termín je možno zažádat na tomto odkaze. S sebou si vezměte:\npas nebo občanku rozšířené potvrzení o studiu (dostupné v portálu mystudies.ethz.ch) nájemní smlouvu (potvrzení o bydlení) 110 CHF (70 CHF za povolení k pobytu a 40 CHF za registraci) důkaz o dostatečných finančních prostředcích, což je buď: dopis od rodičů, ve kterém potrvzují, že jste jejich dítě a že vás budou finančně podporovat částkou 1.750 CHF měsíčně, a nebo bankovní výpis se zůstatkem aspoň 21.000 CHF Po tomto termínu budete poslání na migrační úřad (Migrationsamt Zürich), kde vám budou odebrány biometrické údaje. Povolení k pobytu je kartička, kterou dostane pár týdnů po tomto termínu. Povolení k pobytu je nutné obnovit každý rok.\nBankovní účet Snad všechny banky nabízí výhodné podmínky pro studenty.

A non-profit organisation offerinf some of the most affordable student housing options, including single rooms, shared apartments, and studios. Similarly, Juwo (short for Jugendwohnnetz) is a non-profit providing affordable housing options for students of age 16 \u0026ndash; 25, offering a range of different housing options, including apartments, shared flats, and communal living arrangements.\nTo rent a room from WOKO or Juwo, you must be enrolled in a university in Zurich and under 28, commonly referred to as the Woko criteria.\nWhen should I start looking for a room? It is recommended to start looking for a student room in Zurich at least 2-3 months in advance, as the demand for student housing is extremely high. Even 4-6 months in advance is not too early. Can international students rent student rooms in Zurich? Of course. If you\u0026rsquo;re subletting from Woko, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to provide additional documentation such as proof of enrollment in a university in Zurich.
